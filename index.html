<h1>Creating the ultimate D r o n e</h1>

<p>Recently, one of my English professors demonstrated his Tuvan Throat singing method <br>
and made me want to try to create a similar sound mechanism using my guitar, a violin bow, a formant filter, and two monosynths, in time for Thursday's experimental music club's jam.</p>
<h2>THE PLAN!</h2>
<p>WRITE A DETAILED INSTRUCTION OF HOW I WILL GENERATE A MULTI-TIMBRAL, MULTI-PITCH SOUND BASED ON 2 MONOSYNTHS, A FORMANT FILTER, AND ADDITIONAL PITCHSHIFTING, FROM A SINGLE NOTE PLAYED ON THE GUITAR WITH A BOW, IN TIME FOR THURSDAY</p>

<h3>DANGER! </h3>
<p>WHAT I HAVE TO START WITH:<br>
    VIOLIN BOW <br>
    GUITAR <br>
    <img src="guitarundviol.jpg"style="width:600px;400px;"><br>
    MY PEDALBOARD (BOSS VOCODER, MERIS MONOSYNTH, ZOIA SAXABONE SAX/TROMBONE MONOSYNTH, PITCHSHIFTERS)<br>

    <img src="zoia.jpg"style="width:600px;height:400px"><br>
    22 HOURS TILL START OF JAM [OH NO]<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    oh, and also 25 hours or so before I need to have a website ready, but that's beside the point. <br>
    <br>
    oh well.
    <br>

    <br>
    THE.<br>
    CRUNCH.<br>
    BEGINS.<br>
    NOW.<br>
</p>
<h3>FIRST ISSUE</h3>
<p>AS THE SOUND IS GOING FROM THE ZOIA (MONOSYNTH) TO ENZO (MONOSYNTH), I WOULD BE NOT ABLE TO CREATE THE DESIRED EFFECT (MIX OF GUITAR, ENZO, SAX SYNTH SOUND) AS IF I DO A MIX ON THE ENZO, IT WOULD RESULT IN POLYPHONIC INPUT TO ENZO: PRETTY, EXPERIMENTAL, BUT NOT THE EFFECT DESIRED ATM</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
<p>AS THE ZOIA HAS STEREO OUTS, THE SAX SYNTH AND GUITAR SIGNAL CAN BE ROUTED OUT DIFFERENT OUTPUTS, ONE INTO THE MONOSYNTH, THE OTHER INTO THE RIGHT OUT.<BR>
POSSIBILITY: SETUP A TOGGLEABLE SWITCH, TWO CHANNEL SELECTORS (CHSEL A AND CHSEL B), AND AN INVERTER TO SEND CV INFO TO THE CHANNEL SELECTORS TO CHOOSE WHERE EACH SIGNAL GOES</p>

<P>SETUP: CV SIGNAL FROM TOGGLE SWITCH GOES INTO CHSEL A; SAME VALUE CV SIGNAL FROM TOGGLE SWITCH IS INVERTED BY INVERTER, THEN SENT TO CHSEL B, WHICH STARTS WITH CV AT 5V. RESULT: WHEN CHSEL A IS 0V, CHSEL B IS 5V; WHEN CHSEL A IS 5V, CHSEL B IS 5-5=0V</P>

<h2>what can I upgrade?</h2>
<p>Currently, the sax synth is set a 5th up, and the monosynth (toggleable between square and triangle) is set an octave down<br>
However, we live in an age of technology. A Tuvan throat singer can hit suboctaves and fundamentals, but we can hit those AND change them however we want them to<br>
with the power of MIDI and sequencer</p>
